                    <p>When the first colonists ventured forth from Earth to make their home on the moon, they created a hierarchy for labor. In time, they improved this hierarchy through genetic and surgical manipulation. The result was a colour coded Society of perfect efficiency, dominated by a superior breed of humanity, the Golds. It was they who rebelled against Earth, conquered her, and sowed the seeds of their Society across the Solar System.</p>
